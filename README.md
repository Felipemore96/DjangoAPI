# **Backend Coding Assigment** by Felipe Moreira

### Project Overview

This is a Django-based backend project that provides an API for managing GeoJSON features. The project supports the following functionality:

- CRUD operations for GeoJSON features.
- Spatial filtering using bounding boxes (InBBoxFilter).
- A script to upload GeoJSON files to populate the database.

The project leverages Django REST Framework and GeoDjango for API and geospatial support, respectively.

### Project Structure

- api: Contains the main API logic for managing GeoFeatures.
  - models.py: Contains the GeoFeature model with geospatial fields.
  - serializers.py: Defines serializers for the GeoFeature model.
  - views.py: Handles the API views.
  - urls.py: Defines URL patterns for the API endpoints.
- load_geojson.py: A script to load GeoJSON data into the database.
- settings.py: Contains Django project settings, including database and installed apps configuration.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python Version 3.9 or later
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS enabled for spatial data support
- Django
- GeoDjango Dependencies, libraries like gdal, proj, and libgeos
- pip

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

   Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Felipemore96/DjangoAPI
   cd backend-coding-assignment
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   Install the required packages from requirements.txt:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the database

   This project uses PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension for handling geospatial data. Ensure you have PostgreSQL and PostGIS installed, then configure the database.

   - Create the database:

   ```bash
   createdb geo_backend
   ```

   - Enable PostGIS:

   ```bash
   psql -d geo_backend -c "CREATE EXTENSION postgis;"
   ```

   - Configure your DATABASES setting in settings.py to use the geo_backend database with PostGIS enabled.

4. Apply database migrations

   Run the migrations to create the necessary database tables:

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Load provided GeoJSON data

   Run the script load_geojson.py:

   ```bash
    python load_geojson.py
   ```

### Running the Project

Once youâ€™ve set up the project and database, you can run the Django development server:

1. Start the server

   ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. Access the API

- The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
- The API includes endpoints for creating, retrieving, and filtering GeoFeature objects:
  GET /api/features/: List all GeoFeatures.
  POST /api/features/: Create a new GeoFeature by providing a GeoJSON payload.
  GET /api/features/{id}/: Retrieve a specific GeoFeature by ID.
  GET /api/features/bbox/: Filter features within a bounding box.
